In this workshop we will learn to use the JS and REST APIs from the HERE Location Suite.

#### Step 1 : We render a map and place a marker on our current position
#### Step 2 : We search for all EV charging stations around us and place markers on them
#### Step 3 : We draw a cirle around our position
#### Step 4 : We use isoline routing to find the EV charging stations actually closest to us.
#### Beyond : Final code with visual customizations.
